# **App Name**: ModelVerse

## Core Features:

- Model Upload: Upload one or more AI model files (e.g., .pt, .onnx, .tf) via drag-and-drop or a file selection dialog.
- Model Visualization: Visualize the structure of the AI model(s), showing layers, connections, and input/output shapes for all provided models. Can zoom and pan through the architecture.
- Input Configuration: Allow users to manually configure input data shapes and ranges, and upload their sample data, for model testing.
- Output Display: Display model outputs for given inputs in an easy to interpret format. Support various output types such as numerical vectors, images, text.
- Model Comparison: Provide side-by-side comparisons of model architectures and output for multiple selected models to highlight similarities, differences, and potential for ensembling.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey sophistication and depth, reminiscent of complex systems and AI.
- Background color: A very dark, desaturated purple (#1A1A1D) provides a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the visual elements.
- Accent color: A vibrant, analogous violet (#8A2BE2) is used to draw attention to interactive elements and key information.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto or Open Sans) for readability.
- Use a consistent style for icons throughout the app to provide clear and intuitive navigation (e.g., Font Awesome or Material Icons).
- A modular layout with clear sections for each functional area (model import, visualization, comparison, etc.)
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide a polished user experience.
